   Test Summary

Results received: 3/3
Max absolute error: 0.0078125
Max relative error: 2.00147e-05%
Significant errors: 0

Note on floating-point differences:
- HLS and CPU may have small numerical differences due to:
  1. Different rounding modes
  2. Operation reordering for optimization
  3. Different accumulator precision
- Differences < 0.01% are typically acceptable for optimization
- Your current error of 0.00195312 = 2^-9 is a common rounding pattern

SUCCESS: All tests passed within acceptable tolerance!
